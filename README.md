# What is this repository?

I created this repository to share the files of the bots that I have built for some servers.\
This means that using this code will require some modifications, I used some ids that need to be modified.

## Logger

A discord bot created for a very specific use, to log deleted message from a channel in the server.\
The message log gets simply sent into another channel.\
This bot uses the default repl.it database.

## Zecca

A currecy bot created for a Minecraft server, you can pay other users and use the bal command to see transactions and balance\
The bot uses the mongodb database to store the data.\
It has been created to be used on repl.it but it can be hosted everywhere else.
