# What is this repository?

I created this repository to share the files of the bots that I have built for some servers.\
This means that some modifications will be required if you intend to run this code. Some ids were used as constants.

## ZeccaDelloStato

A currecy bot created for a Minecraft server, you can pay other users and use the bal command to see transactions and balance\
The bot uses the mongodb database to store the data.\
It has been created to be used on replit.com but it can be hosted anywhere else.

This bot also has a related website that is being used for multiple scopes, mainly for downloading the custom texture pack.
